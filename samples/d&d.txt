This is a list of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd-edition monsters, an important element of that role-playing game.[1][2][3] This list only includes monsters from official Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition supplements published by TSR, Inc. or Wizards of the Coast, not licensed or unlicensed third-party products such as video games or unlicensed Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition manuals.

Monsters in the 2nd edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons
The second edition of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game featured both a higher number of books of monsters[4] – "many tied to their growing stable of campaign worlds"[5]: 221  - and more extensive monster descriptions than both earlier[1] and later editions, with usually one page in length.[6][7][8][9][10]: 106–107  Next to a description, monster entries in this edition contained standardized sections covering combat, their habit and society, and their role in the eco-system.[6][7][11] While later editions gave the various creatures all the attributes which player characters had,[9][12] 2nd edition only listed intelligence[6][7] as a characteristic important for creating challenging encounters in the game.[13]

The 2nd edition also used a unique format in the form of Monstrous Compendiums of loose sheets that could be collected in a folder, and allowed the combination of monster books together with individual monster pages from boxed sets.[6][10]: 106–107 [1] This "unruly" format was abandoned again in 1993 in favor of bound books.[5]: 247 [7][14]: 83  In parallel with this change, the 2nd edition introduced colored images for each monster, which became standard in later editions of the game.[15]: 24 [7][9][16] Referencing Wizards of the Coast art director Dawn Murin, GameSpy author Allan Rausch found that until the 2nd edition the artwork depicting monsters was influenced by the popular culture of the late 1970s. As a result, creatures that were fearsome by description were not taken seriously due to ill-suited visuals. Likewise, humanoid monsters too closely resembled humans to be compelling. In the view of Rausch as well as Backstab reviewer Michaël Croitoriu, the Planescape setting marked a turning point for these shortcomings, which also had a significant impact on the presentation of the 3rd edition.[17][18]

The second edition's monsters were based on original inventions, fantasy literature, and mythologies from various cultures.[1][14]: 27, 29  Many monsters were updated from earlier editions, but the 2nd edition also introduced a great number of new creatures.[7][8]

Some types, such as devils and demons, were initially removed by TSR in response to a moral panic promoted by Patricia Pulling's advocacy group Bothered About Dungeons and Dragons (BADD).[19]: 129–130 [20][5]: 223  These were later reintroduced, sometimes with different names to avoid complaints.[14]: 83–84 [21]

TSR 2102 – MC1 – Monstrous Compendium Volume One (1989)
TSR 2102 – MC1 – Monstrous Compendium Volume One (1989) – ISBN 0-88038-738-6
This was the initial volume in the Monstrous Compendium series, for the second edition of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game, published in 1989. Most of the monsters for Volume One were taken from previous first edition AD&D books; the monster entries were greatly expanded and in most cases each monster now filled an entire page and had an all-new illustration. The Monstrous Compendium series consisted of a pack of 5-hole punched loose-leaf pages rather than an actual book, designed to be arranged to the player's preference. Volume One of the Monstrous Compendium was packaged in a box, which contained the pack of monster sheets as well as a binder intended to store the sheets for Volumes One, Two, and Three. The pack consisted of 144 pages, unnumbered, and included a "How To Use This Book" page, with an alphabetical index to Volume One on the back, four pages of monster summoning and random encounter charts, and a blank monster sheet to be photocopied, with the remainder consisting of the monster descriptions. Also included were eight full-page illustrations on heavier card stock.
Note: All monsters from MC1 appeared in the Monstrous Manual (1993), though some had slightly altered headings.

Ewalt, in his book Of Dice and Men, discussed several monsters appearing in the original Monster Manual, describing displacer beasts as looking like "pumas with thorn-covered tentacles growing out of their shoulders".[23]: 138  Rob Bricken from io9 named the displacer beast as the 2nd most memorable D&D monster.[36]

Dragon turtle			Present in the game since its inception.[5]: 26 
Dragonfish
Elemental		Air, Earth, Fire and Water Elementals	Powerful creatures in the game;[44] a characteristic of the air elemental is the ability of rapid movement.[23]: 141 
Elephant		African elephant, Mammoth, Mastodon and Oliphant
Elf		High elf, Grey elf (Faerie), Wood elf, Half-elf	Based on Tolkien's version of the elf,[3] "quick but fragile", with senses surpassing a human's, often depicted as "effeminate" and "predisposed towards a "good" moral alignment".[26]: 14, 26, 68 
Genie	Monster Manual (1977) (Djinn,[5]: 247  efreet), Al-Qadim – Land of Fate	Djinn, Dao and Efreeti	Based on notions from Middle Eastern culture,[2][5]: 244  genies in the game are powerful elemental spirits from the Inner Planes, each of the four classical elements having its own subspecies of genie: djinn for air, dao for earth, efreet for fire. The djinn and efreet have namesakes from Arabic folklore also associated with air and fire, respectively. The dao were newly invented for the game altogether to fill the gap for the remaining element.[45]: 485–493  A depiction of an "evil [...] efreet" already appeared in the original Dungeons & Dragons (1974) edition, another "enormous, devilish red" one was the main feature of the cover of the 1st edition Dungeon Master's Guide. Within the game's cosmology they were based on the Plane of Fire, centered around the "fabled City of Brass". They feature especially in the Al-Qadim setting. AD&D's djinn were also adapted into the Magic: The Gathering trading card game, with a depiction taken from the Monster Manual being used in a prototype version.[5]: 20–21, 85, 87, 244–245, 247 
Ghost			Inspired by Gothic fiction, a typical denizen of the Ravenloft setting.[35]
Ghoul	Monster Manual (1977)[5]: 247 	Ghoul, Lacedon and Ghast	Undead with "terrible claws".[23]: 175  AD&D's ghouls were also adapted into the Magic: The Gathering trading card game, with a depiction taken from the Monster Manual being used in a prototype version.[5]: 247 
Giant		Cloud, Fire, Frost, Hill, Stone and Storm Giant	Overlarge powerful humanoids with a self-involved social focus,[45]: 8  usually presented as the "bad guys".[46] Based on mythological figures and Tolkien, their stone-throwing ability indicates their creative roots in wargaming.[33][1]
Gnoll		Gnoll and Flind	Vicious humanoids with hyena-like heads. Richard W. Forest assumed them to be inspired from but not resembling the gnoles conceived by Lord Dunsany,[1] while Gary Gygax himself stated that although Dunsany's "gnole" is close", he came up with the name as "a cross between a gnome and a troll", and the description was his original creation. He wanted to create a humanoid opponent in the game to fit in between the hobgoblin and bugbear in power.[47] Gnolls were considered one of the "five main "humanoid" races" in AD&D by Paul Karczag and Lawrence Schick.[10]: 92 
Gnome			Player character race "often stereotyped as buffoons, illusionists, mad inventors, and many characters play them as intentionally "wacky" or anachronistic"; often conforms to the trickster archetype. "predisposed towards a "good" moral alignment".[26]: 23, 31, 67 
Goblin			Based primarily on the goblins portrayed in J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-Earth.[48] Considered one of the "five main "humanoid" races" in AD&D by Paul Karczag and Lawrence Schick.[10]: 92  Presented as "evil" and "predisposed towards a society of brutal regimes where the strongest rule" in the game.[26]: 48, 66, 134  Suitable opponent for characters of lowest level.[49]
Golem, lesser	Strategic Review No. 4[14]: 22  (Clay)	Flesh and Clay	The clay golem is based on the golem of Medieval Jewish folklore, though changed from "a cherished defender to an unthinking hulk"[50][33] while the flesh golem is related to Frankenstein's monster as Universal's 1931 film, seen in e.g. being empowered by electricity,[1] as well as Gothic fiction more generally; a typical denizen of the Ravenloft setting,[35] and "classic" monster of the game.[27] The influence of Dungeons & Dragons has led to the inclusion of golems in other tabletop role-playing as well as in video games.[51]
Golem, greater		Stone and Iron	Inspired by Gothic fiction, a typical denizen of the Ravenloft setting,[35] and "classic" monster of the game.[27]
Halfling		Hairfoot, Tallfellow and Stout	Based on the hobbit in J.R.R. Tolkien's works.[1][14]: 27  The hobbit first appeared as a player character class in the original 1974 edition of Dungeons & Dragons.[52]: 62  Later the game began using the name "halfling" as an alternative to "hobbit" for legal reasons.[5]: 71 [53] The "halfling" appeared as a player character race in the original Player's Handbook (1978).[10]: 84–85 
Harpy			Based on the creature from Greek mythology.[3]
Hobgoblin		Koalinth	Muscular humanoids somewhat taller than humans with reddish skin and canine teeth.[23]: 215  Koalinth are an undersea variation.[54] Reviewer Declan Lowthian included them among the "15 Best Monsters For Coastal D&D Adventures", because the provide a more organized and tactical opponent than most other coastal creatures of the game, and also could be negotiated with rather than providing purely combat encounters.[55]
Homonculous
Hornet, giant		Hornet and Wasp
Horse		Draft horse, Heavy Warhorse, Medium Warhorse, Light Warhorse, Pony, Wild horse, Riding horse and Mule
Hydra	Monster Manual (1977)[5]: 247 	Hydra, Lernaean Hydra, Pyrohydra and Cryohydra	Based on the creature from classical sources,[1][34] with Heracles' famed method of slaying it adapted into a vulnerability against fire, but not with the less well-known venomous bite, showing how the game mostly focusses on the well-known traits of mythological creatures.[32] Present in the game since its inception.[5]: 26  AD&D's hydra was also adapted into the Magic: The Gathering trading card game, with a depiction taken from the Monster Manual being used in a prototype version.[5]: 247 
Hyena		Hyena and Hyaenodon
Imp	Planescape Monstrous Compendium Appendix	Imp and Quasit	Minor fiends which could be created from larvae.[56] Reviewer Philippe Tessier found the quasit "very nice" and interesting when made available as a familiar.[27][5]: 4 
Invisible stalker
Jackal
Jackalwere			An intelligent jackal with the ability to assume human and jackal-human-hybrid form and a sleep-inducing gaze.[45]: 66–67 [5]: 133 
Kobold			"[S]hort subterranean lizard-men",[23]: 66  considered one of the "five main "humanoid" races" in AD&D by Paul Karczag and Lawrence Schick,[10]: 92  and ranked among the weakest monsters in the game by Scott Baird from Screen Rant.[57]
Korred			Based on the korred from Breton mythology.[58]
Lich	Demilich: The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth, Monster Manual II (1983), Epic Level Handbook (2002), Monster Manual (2014)	Lich and Demilich	Lich: Emaciated[27] undead spellcaster,[59] a "classic" monster of the game.[27] Demilich: Evolved beyond status as a lich. Creature of enormous powers, where only the skull remains.[60] Tyler Linn of Cracked.com identified the demi-lich as one of "15 Idiotic Dungeons and Dragons Monsters" in 2009, stating: "Besides looking like a Pirates of the Caribbean alarm clock, the Demi-lich seems to possess no tactical advantages of any kind. It just kind of floats around, waiting for a party of heroes to smack it out of the air like a pinata. We suppose it could try to bite you, but the illustration above kind of makes it look like the jaw is fused in place. Man, now we just feel sorry for it."[61] Ranked among the strongest in Screen Rant's "10 Most Powerful (And 10 Weakest) Monsters, Ranked", saying "You might think that a floating skull would be easy to smash to pieces, but you would be wrong, as demiliches are some of the most resilient creatures in the game."[57]
Lizard		Fire, Giant, Minotaur and Subterranean lizards
Lizard man	Greyhawk, Monster Manual (1977), Fiend Folio (1981), Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set, Dungeons & Dragons Game, Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia (1991), Classic Dungeons & Dragons Game (1994), Dungeons & Dragons Adventure Game (1999), Hollow World Campaign Set, Dragonlance Monstrous Compendium, The Complete Spacefarer's Handbook, The Complete Book of Humanoids, Player's Option: Skills & Powers, Mind Lords of the Last Sea, Polyhedron No. 121 (1996), Monster Manual (2000) (from here on as lizardfolk), Races of Faerûn, Monster Manual (2003), Dragon No. 318 (2004), Serpent Kingdoms, Eberron Campaign Setting, Monster Manual III (2004), Dragon No. 335 (2005), Monster Manual IV (2006), Monster Manual (2008), Monster Vault: Threats to the Nentir Vale, Monster Manual (2014), Volo's Guide to Monsters	Lizard Man, Lizard King	Lizardfolk are primitive reptilian humanoids typically standing from six to seven feet tall. A player character race in some settings.[62][63] Reviewer Chris Gigoux described them by saying "Lizard Men aren't bad, [...] they're just a simple folks, struggling to survive."[64] In 2020, Comic Book Resources counted the lizardfolk as # 1 on the list of "10 Powerful Monster Species That You Should Play As", stating that "Along with the ability to manufacture their own weapons from the natural environment around them, they provide an excellent role-playing experience and have some pretty awesome tricks up their sleeve."[65] An image of a lizard man by Greg Bell functioned as the logo in the early phase of TSR Hobbies,[5]: 42–43, 47, 81  while "the bloodied bodies of lizard men" overcome by a group of adventurers featured on the cover of the 1st edition Player's Handbook, considered "arguably the most iconic piece of art in all of RPGdom" by Reactor magazine commentator Saladin Ahmed.[66]
Lycanthrope	Werewolf: Dungeons & Dragons "white box" set (1974), Monster Manual (1977), Dragon, Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set (1977, 1981, 1983), Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia (1991), Night Howlers (1992), Monster Manual (2000), Monster Manual (2003), Dragon No. 313, Monster Manual (2008)	Werebear, Wererat, Lesser and greater Seawolf, Weretiger and Werewolf	Afflicted shapechangers, whose condition could be transmitted like a disease;[67] some available as player character races.
Depiction of the werewolf is related to those in 1930s and 1940s Hollywood movies like The Wolf Man.[1] Ranked sixth among the ten best low-level monsters by the authors of Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies: "a classic monster", interesting due to shapechanging because "players can never be entirely sure whether that surly villager might indeed be the great black wolf who attacked their characters out in the forest."[68]: 373  The presence of lycanthropes in the gaming system is one of the elements that has led Christian fundamentalists to condemn Dungeons & Dragons and to associate it with the occult.[69] Screen Rant has described the operation of lycanthropy in the game as an aspect that "makes no sense" because it is often a positive development for a character. "It is possible for a character to be infected with lycanthropy in Dungeons & Dragons and it comes highly recommended, as the benefits outweigh the negatives". It notes that "[i]n exchange for learning how to control your condition, you gain Damage Reduction, +2 to your Wisdom stat, the Scent ability, Low-Light Vision, a new Hit Dice, the Iron Will feat, and the ability to transform into a more powerful form".[70] An illustration in one edition of the Monster Manual implied that the beast in Disney's Beauty and the Beast was a lycanthrope, with a creature having a resemblance to the Beast attacking a human resembling that film's antagonist, Gaston.[71] Present in the game since its inception, an image of a werewolf's face by Gygax' childhood friend Tom Keogh was "[a]lmost certainly the oldest piece of art" in the original D&D.[5]: 26–27 
Manticore			Based on its mythological counterpart, including the barbed tail, the manticore appeared in the game from its earliest edition.[72]: 44 [73]: 268 
Medusa		Normal and Greater	Based on the creature from classical sources[1][3][34] but translated into species of monsters[29][34] originated from "humans seeking eternal youth".[32] Reviewer Allan Rausch found their portrayal as "a woman with snakes for hair" up to 2nd edition less compelling than their less human-like depiction in 3rd edition.[17] Part of the game from its very beginning, a medusa was already depicted in the playtest material from 1973 for the original edition.[5]: 21 
Men		Aborigines/Cavemen, Adventurers, Bandits/Brigands, Barbarians/Nomads, Berserkers/Dervishes, Farmers/Herders, Gentry, Knights, Mercenary Soldiers, Merchant Sailors/Fishermen, Merchants/Traders, Middle Class, Peasantry (serfs), Pilgrims, Pirates/Buccaneers, Police/Constabulary, Priests, Sailors, Slavers, Soldiers, Thieves/Thugs, Tradesmen/Craftsmen, Tribesmen, and Wizards	Human variants. The game aims to present humans with the same diversity found in the real world and more, but in most cases they are statistically comparatively homogeneous, and depictions have often suffered from Eurocentrism. As the players are humans, in the game humans are the standard against which other playable races are compared,[12] and often promoted "as the best or most versatile characters",[74] while up to 2nd edition AD&D class restrictions for non-humans guided choices "always in favor of...bland humanity."[5]: 306  Berserkers are based on the berserkir, "men of Odin, whom the god made strong like wild beasts", from Icelandic sagas and Snorri Sturluson's history of the kings of Norway.[75]
Mind flayer	Strategic Review No. 1[14]: 22 		Also known as illithids, these "Squid-headed humanoids" were considered one of "the game's signature monsters" by Philip J. Clements.[26]: 133  Reviewer Julien Blondel described them as vile brain-eating creatures full of psionic energy. He found them delightful creatures for a sadistic Dungeon Master to use, and a useful bridge between classic game worlds and the planes, as illithids abound in both.[76]
Minotaur	Dungeons & Dragons (1974),[77] Monster Manual (1977)[5]: 247 		Based on the creature from Greek mythology,[1][3][32][78] but translated from a singular creature into a species.[34] In 2021, Comic Book Resources counted the minotaur as one of the "7 Underused Monster Races in Dungeons & Dragons", stating that "far from just brutal monsters. Many are lawful by nature, which means, surprisingly, Minotaurs make for some good Paladins. They also, obviously, make for some good Barbarians, Monks and Fighters. There's a lot of potential with Minotaurs. People hate and fear them, but you might be able to play that to your advantage...or fight against the stereotypes."[79] The minotaur was among the monsters featured as trading cards on the back of Amurol Products candy figure boxes. AD&D's minotaurs were also adapted into the Magic: The Gathering trading card game, with a depiction taked from the Monster Manual being used in a prototype version.[5]: 161, 163, 247 
Mud-man			Screen Rant compiled a list of the game's "10 Most Powerful (And 10 Weakest) Monsters, Ranked" in 2018, calling this one of the weakest, saying "The mudmen are magically bound to their pool of mud, which means that the only way they can defeat an enemy is if they walk right into the middle of a dirty puddle. They will then have to score numerous hits in order to prevent the enemy from running away."[57]
Mummy			Powerful undead usually from desert areas, wrapped in bandages. Based on the creature from Gothic fiction and appearances in more contemporary entertainment, a typical denizen of the Ravenloft setting.[35][80] In his review of the Monster Manual in the British magazine White Dwarf No. 8 (August/September 1978), Don Turnbull noted that the mummy was revised from its previous statistics, and could now cause paralysis on sight (as a result of fear).[81]
Nixie
Nymph			Based on the nymph from Greek mythology,[1][3] also an instance of the sexist tropes the game draws on which presented female sexuality as inherently dangerous.[26]: 94  Appeared in the movie Futurama: Bender's Game.[82]
Ogre		Ogre, Ogre mage and Merrow	Large, powerful humanoid creatures, with slightly below average intelligence.[45]: 249, 257 [83] Typical bad guys in the game,[46] who can be used to teach "players about fighting big, powerful, stupid monsters, which is an iconic D&D experience".[68]: 356 
Oozes/slimes/jellies		Ochre Jelly, Gray Ooze, Crystal Ooze, Gelatinous cube and Green Slime	"D&D's large variety of monstrous oozes and slimes took their original inspiration from Irvin S. Yeathworth Jr's The Blob" movie. In the artificial dungeon environment of the game, they function as a "clean up crew". The gelatinous cube, "a living mound of gelatinous jelly",[23]: 138  was considered especially suited for that role, as it fit exactly in the standard grid for tactical combat. Considered an "iconic monster".[1] SyFy Wire contributor Lisa Granshaw counted oozes among "The 9 Scariest, Most Unforgettable Monsters From Dungeons & Dragons" and found them "extremely disturbing because everything may seem fine one minute and then the next you're on the way to death."[84] D&D's slimes have served as inspiration for appearances of this kind of monster in many video games.[85]
Orc		Orc and Orog	Directly adapted from the orc in J.R.R. Tolkien's works.[1] Considered one of the "five main "humanoid" races" in AD&D by Paul Karczag and Lawrence Schick.[10]: 92  Presented as "evil" and "savage raiders" in the game.[26]: 48, 95 
Owl		Normal, Giant and Talking
Owlbear			Newly created for the game early on inspired by a Hong Kong–made plastic toy,[86][5]: 66  the owlbear was well-received as a useful and memorable monster.[36][87][88]
Pegasus			Winged horse. Taken from greek mythology, an example of the diverse cultures amalgamated into D&D.[32][89] Part of the game from its very beginning, a pegasus was already depicted in the playtest material from 1973 for the original edition.[5]: 21 
Piercer	Strategic Review No. 3[14]: 22 
Pseudodragon			"a miniature dragon that also has a tail stinger"[37] Reviewer Philippe Tessier found it "very nice" and interesting when made available as a familiar.[27]
Puddings, deadly		Black, White, Dun and Brown	"D&D's large variety of monstrous oozes and slimes took their original inspiration from Irvin S. Yeathworth Jr's The Blob" movie.[1]
Rakshasa	Strategic Review No. 3[14]: 22 	Normal and Greater	Based on the creature from Hindu mythology.[35] Humanoid fiends with tigerlike-features, Reactor magazine commentator Saladin Ahmed rated them as "ultimate badass monsters". He found a depiction sitting with pipe and smoking-jacket fitting on second thought, as the creature is so powerful it has no need to prove its dangerousness.[66]
Rat		Common and Giant	Example of a monster posing little threat to the characters in the game,[23]: 22  suitable for play at lowest level.[49]
Ray		Manta, Pungi and Sting Rays, Ixitxachitl
Remorhaz
Satyr			Based on the satyr from classical sources.[1]
Scorpion		Large, Huge and Giant	Scorpions have the distinction of having been the very first combat encounter in the first playtest, run by Gary Gygax, of the original version of the game.[23]: 65–66  Giant: Scorpion the size of a horse, its stinger carries a deadly poison.[39]: 148–149 
Selkie
Shadow			In his review of the Monster Manual in the British magazine White Dwarf No. 8 (August/September 1978), Don Turnbull noted his disappointment that the shadow is of the undead class and thus subject to a cleric's turn undead ability. Turnbull commented, "I used to enjoy seeing clerics vainly trying to turn what wouldn't turn, when Shadows were first met".[81] Rob Bricken of io9 identified the shadow as one of "The 12 Most Obnoxious Dungeons & Dragons Monsters".[90]
Skeleton	Dungeons & Dragons "white box" set (1974), Monster Manual (1977), Dragon No. 66, Monster Manual II (1983), Dragon No. 138, Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set (1977, 1981, 1983), Dungeons & Dragons Game set (1991), Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia (1991), Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia (1991), Dungeons & Dragons Adventure Game (1999), Monstrous Compendium Volume One, Ravenloft Monstrous Compendium Appendix III: Creatures of Darkness (1994), Monster Manual (2000), Monster Manual (2003), Libris Mortis: The Book of Undead, Monster Manual (2008)	Normal, Animal skeleton and Monster skeleton	Skeleton of a deceased creature animated as an undead. The skeleton was ranked second among the ten best low-level monsters by the authors of Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies: "introduces players to the special advantages and weaknesses of undead monsters". They also thank Ray Harryhausen for people knowing what fighting skeletons ought to look like.[68] Screen Rant ranked the tiny skeleton one of the weakest D&D creatures, saying "[skeletons] go all the way down to Tiny-sized creatures, which means that it is possible for your party of adventurers to fight a group of skeletons that are the same size as action figures."[57]
Skunk		Normal and Giant
Snake		Constrictor (Normal and Giant), Poisonous (Normal and Giant), Giant Sea and Giant Spitting Snakes
Spectre			Inspired by Gothic fiction, a typical denizen of the Ravenloft setting.[35]
Spider		Large, Huge, Giant, Giant Water, Giant Marine and Phase Spiders	Phase spider: Arachnid as big as a medium-large dog that can shift between dimensions and bite with fangs of deadly poison.[39]: 148–149 
Sprite
Toad, giant		Giant, Fire, Ice and Poisonous Toads
Treant			Based on the Ent by J. R. R. Tolkien[1][14]: 27  and renamed due to copyright reasons.[5]: 71 
Troll		Troll, Two-Headed Troll, Freshwater and Saltwater Scrag	Tall green-skinned[43] evil gaunt humanoids. A characteristic denizen of AD&D worlds.[2] Their appearance and powerful regenerative ability is taken from Three Hearts and Three Lions by Poul Anderson rather than from their mythological or Tolkienesque counterparts.[1][33][75] Considered one of the "five main "humanoid" races" in AD&D by Paul Karczag and Lawrence Schick.[10]: 92 
Umber hulk		Umber Hulk and Vodyanoi	They are a type of humanoid insect. They have long mandible arms with powerful claws. Anyone looking into their eyes can be driven mad. Present in the game since the earliest edition.[5]: 45 
Unicorn			Based on the creature from medieval bestiaries.[1][35] The Dungeons & Dragons animated series featured Uni the unicorn as well-received "mascot" and "cute animal sidekick".[91]
Vampire			Depiction is related to those in 1930s and 1940s Hollywood Dracula movies,[1] as well as folklore[80] and Gothic fiction; a typical denizen of the Ravenloft setting[35][2] and "classic" monster of the game.[27]
Wight			Thin humanoid undead.[92] Directly adapted from the barrow-wight in Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings,[1][14]: 27  while the concept is inspired by Icelandic sagas.[75] Rob Bricken of io9 identified the wight as one of "The 12 Most Obnoxious Dungeons & Dragons Monsters".[90]
Will o'wisp
Wolf		Wolf, Dire Wolf, Worg, Winter wolf	Worgs are giant wolves inspired by the wargs in the works of J.R.R. Tolkien; the name was changed for legal reasons, while both the word and concept ultimately go back to Old Norse idea of varg, which can refer to wolves in their violent aspect.[75]
Wolfwere			A reverse of a werewolf, that transforms from a wolf to either a humanoid or an humanoid-wolf hybrid instead of from a human to a humanoid wolf.
Wraith			Inspired by Gothic fiction, a typical denizen of the Ravenloft setting.[35]
Wyvern			Dragon-like in overall appearance, the wyvern features a serpentine head, wings, scales, but only two legs and no breath weapon. Its tail is equipped with a poisonous tail stinger.[37]
Yeti
Yuan-ti			A species of "cult-like snake people"[93] and among "D&D's most popular and iconic monsters".[94] The original yuan-ti castes were the abominations, the halfbreeds, and the purebloods, which first appeared in the module Dwellers of the Forbidden City (1981),[95][96][97] In the adventure, the characters are hired to find an object taken to a lost oriental-style city, which has been taken over by a cult of snake-worshipers, the yuan-ti, and their servants, the mongrelmen and tasloi.[10]: 101  The types have been summarized by A.V. Club as "a human-eating snake, or human-snake hybrid eater of humans and snakes, or other human-snake hybrids."[98] Snakes and snake-worship used in fiction have been criticized as characteristic of Orientalism.[99] The publication history, digital and print, of yuan-ti falls into this pattern as they serve as uncomplicated antagonists in "exotic" settings.[45][100][101] Graeme Barber, a game designer noted for his critique of racism in Dungeons & Dragons,[102] used yuan-ti in his contribution to the book Candlekeep Mysteries. Controversy arose after Wizards of the Coast, according to Barber, altered his depiction of yuan-ti.[103] Summarizing his critique of the simplistic portrayal, Barber wrote, "Yuan-ti are evil because evil."[104] Keith Ammann, in his 2019 book The Monsters Know What They're Doing, commented of the yuan-ti purebloods that "Yuan-ti have had hundreds of generations to live and adapt on their own, so they'll have the same self-preservation instinct as any evolved species."[45] TheGamer.com in April 2021 listed the yuan-ti pureblood as No. 2 on their list of "10 Most Underrated Races That Are Better Than You Think".[105] CBR.com listed the yuan-ti pure blood as No. 5 on their list of "Top 10 Playable Species In D&D".[106]
Zombie		Common, Monster and Ju-Ju Zombie	Based on the zombie from folklore as well as more contemporary entertainment.[80]

TSR 2103 – MC2 – Monstrous Compendium Volume Two (1989) – ISBN 0-88038-753-X
This was the second volume in the Monstrous Compendium series, for the second edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, published in 1989. As with Volume One, most of the monsters for Volume Two were taken from previous first edition AD&D books, with greatly expanded entries that now filled an entire page and had an all-new illustration. Volume Two was packaged in a wraparound cover, and the pages were designed to fit in the binder that came with Volume One of the Monstrous Compendium. The pack consisted of 144 pages, unnumbered, and included a 2-page alphabetical index to Volume One and Volume Two, 10 pages of monster summoning and random encounter charts, and a blank monster sheet to be photocopied with a sheet of instructions for the blank monster form, with the remainder consisting of the monster descriptions. Also included were 8 full-page illustrations on heavier card stock.

Beetle		Bombardier, Boring, Fire, Rhinoceros, Stag and Water
Bulette			Also called land shark, inspired by a plastic toy from Hong Kong.[1] In his 2019 book The Monsters Know What They're Doing, author Keith Ammann called bulettes "brutes tailor-made to give your players jump scares" and found its preferences and aversions for the meat of different humanoid races "ludicrous".[45]: 157–158 
Bullywug
Crocodile		Normal and giant
Crustacean, giant		Giant Crab and Giant Crayfish
Dolphin
Doppleganger
Dragonne	Monster Manual (1977)[5]: 164–165 		Lion-headed dragon-like creature, it was "Originally described as 'a weird cross between a brass dragon and a giant lion'". Present "in every edition of the game", James Wyatt stated it was "probably the oldest manifestation in the game of the idea of a half-dragon". Renamed to liondrake in 5th edition.[108][5]: 164–165 
Dryad			Based on the dryad from classical sources.[1] The dryad appears as a player character class in Tall Tales of the Wee Folk in the "DM's booklet" (1989).[10]: 146 
Dwarf		Hill and Mountain	Based on Tolkien's version of the dwarf.[3][26]: 78  Often depicted as "short, stout, and fond of ale", "bearded masters of metalworking" and "predisposed towards a "good" moral alignment", "tend to embody an extreme vision of masculinity".[26]: 58, 67, 78, 165 
Dwarf, duergar		Duergar and Steeder (Giant Spider)	"the infamous dark dwarves",[109] an "evil and avaricious" dwarven subrace[110]: 152  with psionic powers. ComicBook.com contributor Christian Hoffer considered the struggle of the duergar with their dwarven cousins one "of the great conflicts that make up the D&D multiverse".[111] Backstab reviewer Michaël Croitoriu found the duergar interesting as a player character option.[46]
Eagle		Wild and giant
Eel		Electric, Giant, Marine and Weed
Elf, Drow		Drow and Drider	Made famous by R. A. Salvatore's Drizzt novels, these dark elves from the game influenced subsequent works of fantasy.[1] Drow have a gender-based caste system that says "a great deal about attitudes towards gender roles in the real world".[26]: 34  A drider is a "monster that looks like a centaur only with the bottom half of a spider instead of a horse."[112]
Ettercap
Ettin
Fish, giant		Giant Catfish, Giant Gar and Giant Pike
Frog		Giant, killer and poisonous
Fungus	Strategic Review No. 3[14]: 22  (Shrieker)	Violet Fungus, Shrieker, Phycomid, Ascomoid and Gas Spore	Author Ben Woodard called D&D's fungi horrific in their variety, not only due to their poisonous nature but their creepy ability to move.[113] Scott Baird from Screen Rant ranked the man-sized shrieker among the weakest monsters in the game, at "the bottom of the mushroom monster food chain": They "can be used as cheap alarm systems for Underdark societies, but they possess no combat abilities of their own. The only thing a shrieker can do is shriek".[57]
Galeb duhr
Gargoyle	Monster Manual (1977)[5]: 247 	Gargoyle and Margoyle	AD&D's gargoyle was adapted into the Magic: The Gathering trading card game, with a depiction taken from the Monster Manual being used in a prototype version.[5]: 247 
Genie	Al-Qadim – Land of Fate	Jann and Marid	Based on notions from Middle Eastern culture,[2] genies in the game are powerful elemental spirits from the Inner Planes, each of the four classical elements having its own subspecies of genie. Marids were largely changed from their mythological namesakes to fit to the element of water. Keith Ammann assumes the game's creators were inspired by the syllable mar- meaning "sea" in Latin, even though there is no such connection in Arabic.[45]: 485–493 
Giant-kin, Cyclops	Dungeons & Dragons "white box" set (1974), Gods, Demi-gods & Heroes (1976)m Deities & Demigods Cyclopedia (1980) (Greater and lesser), Legends & Lore (1985), Monster Manual II (1983) (Cyclopskin), Dungeons & Dragons Expert Set (1981 & 1983), Dungeons & Dragons Game, Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia (1991), Classic Dungeons & Dragons Game (1994), Dungeons & Dragons Adventure Game (1999), Legends & Lore (1990), Deities and Demigods (2002), Shining South (2004), Monster Manual (2008), Monster Manual 2 (2009) Monster Manual (2014)		One-eyed giants[114] based on Greek mythology.[33] Ranked tenth among the ten best mid-level 4th Edition monsters by the authors of Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition For Dummies.[114]
Giant-kin, firbolg			Bleeding Cool found the firbolg one "of the more distinctive race options in the D&D multiverse".[94] Comic Book Resources counted them as one of the "7 Underused Monster Races in Dungeons & Dragons", stating that "Firbolgs are a blend of strength and magic, making them useful for classes that blend the two. Firbolgs work well as Clerics and Druids, but they can also make for a good Ranger. Your harmony with nature will leave you definitely wanting to have a nature focus, but you'll also stand out in a crowd. As a naturally shy race, be sure to consider that when playing your character. Typically speaking, Firbolgs aren't aggressive."[79]
Giant-kin, fomorian
Giant-kin, verbeeg
Gorgon			"iron plated bull", based on early modern bestiaries, with only the name being derived from the Classical counterpart.[32][33]

Guardian daemon		Least, lesser and greater
Hag		Annis, Greenhag and Sea Hag	Immortal wicked and ugly powerful females with magical abilities for deception. Based on the pervasive figure from folklore, with "different interpretations of the monster around the world" being worked into different variants in the game, allowing each "a little more personality".[80] In the view of Stang and Trammel, hags in D&D represent misogynistic and ageist tendencies in their authors.[56][115] SyFy Wire in 2018 called it one of "The 9 Scariest, Most Unforgettable Monsters From Dungeons & Dragons", saying that "There are endless horrific possibilities when it comes to hags."[84]
Haunt
Hawk		Large (hawk), Small (falcon) and Blood Hawk
Hell hound			In his review of the Monster Manual, Don Turnbull noted in the British magazine White Dwarf No. 8 (August/September 1978) that the breath weapon of the "much-feared" hell hound had been altered from its previous appearance.[81]

Hippocampus			Based on medieval bestiaries. "Depicted as the front half of a horse and the rear half of a fish or sea-serpent."[33] Tyler Linn of Cracked.com listed it among the "15 Most Idiotic Monsters In Dungeons & Dragons History". He did not think " it would pose much of a threat" "and was intended to be one of the good guys", but found the depiction "douchey".[61]
Hippogriff			Originally based on the creature from Persian mythology[35] the adapted hippogriff "was among the earliest fantasy beasts introduced into the Dungeons & Dragons universe":[72] An artistic representation drawing inspiration from real eagles and horses was used for the cover of the third booklet of the original Dungeons & Dragons (1974) edition and became one of "the game's earlies ambassadors" through use of that cover in advertisements.[5]: 20–21, 27, 39  Gary Gygax used a story in which he received a letter asking how many eggs a Hippogriff could lay as an example of the encyclopedic knowledge which fans expected him to have over every detail of gameplay.[116]

Kelpie
Kenku			Crow-like humanoids with a tendency for thievery, loosely based on the Japanese tengu.[117][45]: 56–58

Obliviax (memory moss)			A black moss that steals memories and forms a tiny version of the robbed person which can use the memories to fight. The obliviax appeared on Geek.com's list of "The most underrated monsters of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons", because ingesting the moss can transfer the memories, an "interesting" concept which lends itself to "Christopher Nolan-esque adventures that will be both universally applauded and terribly confusing at the same time."[119]

An original invention for the game and its artificial underground world, the appearance of the rust monster was inspired by a plastic toy from Hong Kong.[124] It was ranked among the most memorable as well as obnoxious creatures in the game, terrifying to certain characters and their players not due to their ability to fight but to destroy their items.[1][36][90][5]: 91, 93 [23]: 138  Chris Sims of the on-line magazine Comics Alliance referred to the rust monster as "the most feared D&D monster".[125]

Shark		Common and giant (megalodon)
Slithering tracker			Intelligent stealthy jelly creature. Either evolved from simpler relatives, or persons magically transfigured[7] "by hags and liches into a blobby puddle of remains" motivated by revenge. Reviewer Zack Furniss saw the monster on the "more horrific side of D&D" and observed: "even once they've found their vengeance, they're still a nasty blob and often go insane because they can't find satiation or communicate. Grim stuff."[126]

Tasloi
Triton			An aquatic race[126] based on the merman in Greek mythology.[33]
Troglodyte			Based on the stock character of the primitive caveman, Gary Gygax portrayed the troglodyte in the game as more monstrous, with chaotic and evil behaviour, offensive smell and lizard-like characteristics.[128] The troglodyte was among the monsters featured as trading cards on the back of Amurol Products candy figure boxes.[5]: 161, 163

Xorn
Yellow musk creeper & zombie	Fiend Folio (1981)[5]: 247 		Creeping plant that drains the intelligence of its victims, possibly turning them into "zombies" under the plant's control. Ben Woodard found it an expression of the "seemingly endless morphology of fungal creep and toxicological capacity" within the game.[113] The Fiend Folio's illustration of the yellow msuk creeper was used by Richard Garfield for the prototype of the Regrowth spell card during the development of his Magic: The Gathering game.[5]: 247

It appeared in the TV series Stranger Things.[134][135] Reviewer matseric observed that the chances to overcome this creature only as a team hearkens back to Hercules and Iolaus working together to defeat the original hydra.[135] In the lore of the game, these monsters were originally "designed" by a lich character named Thessalar.

Einheriar	Planescape Monstrous Compendium Appendix (1994)		Based on the "Einheriar" of Norse mythology but expanded from their cultural background to mean "any humanoid spirit employed by the powers or deities of the outer planes as servants, warriors, patrollers or guards", not only by the fictionalized version of the Norse pantheon; thus an example how "game authors and designers transform and adapt references from various sources, not hesitating to articulate or even merge them into new forms."[75]
Gehreleth	Planescape Monstrous Compendium Appendix (1994)	Farastu, Kelubar and Shator
Githyanki	Monstrous Manual (1993), Planescape Monstrous Compendium Appendix (1994)		Xenophobic humanoids[26]: 20–21  with gaunt stature, leathery yellow skin and fangs. Inhabitants of the Astral Plane, and ancient enemies of the githzerai, githyanki are considered to "boast some excellent twists" as non-player characters, but "little more than dextrous, not to mention ugly, egg layers" as PCs by reviewer Trenton Webb[157][156][158] Introduced by Charles Stross[155][14]: 38  in White Dwarf No. 12, and officially included in the game in Fiend Folio (1981) and featured on its cover.[5]: 127–129  The name was borrowed the name from a fictional race in George R. R. Martin's Dying of the Light. The githyanki/illithid relationship was inspired by Larry Niven's World of Ptavvs.[159][146] The githyanki were voted among the top ten best monsters from that White Dwarf's "Fiend Factory" column.[130] Shannon Applecline considered the githyanki one of the game's especially notable monsters.[14]: 38  Scott Baird of the website TheGamer commented on the nature of the relationship of the githyanki to the mind flayers, to whom they were formerly enslaved: "Despite their wicked reputation, the Githyanki have an important role to play in protecting the Prime Material Plane. The Githyanki despise Mind Flayers and their armies might be the only thing holding them back. The trailer for Baldur's Gate 3 shows just how scary a single Mind Flayer ship can be, and that could happen a thousand times over if the Githyanki aren't around."[160][158] ComicBook.com contributor Christian Hoffer considered "the conflict between the otherworldly githzerai and githyanki" one "of the great conflicts that make up the D&D multiverse".[111]
Githzerai	Monstrous Manual (1993), Planescape Monstrous Compendium Appendix (1994)	Zerth, Rrakkma band	Designed by Charles Stross,[155][14]: 38  these humanoids are the ancient and fervent enemies of mind flayers, to whom they were formerly enslaved, and the githyanki; they are based on the plane of Limbo. A playable species in the Planescape campaign setting, reviewer Johnny L. Wilson found them a new take on the niche usually occupied by elves.[156][161][158] Shannon Applecline considered the githzerai one of the game's especially notable monsters,[14]: 38  while ComicBook.com contributor Christian Hoffer counted "the conflict between the otherworldly githzerai and githyanki" among "the great conflicts that make up the D&D multiverse".[111]
Hordling	Planescape Monstrous Compendium Appendix (1994)
Larva	Planescape Monstrous Compendium Appendix (1994)		Evil mortal transformed into comparatively harmless larva-like creature by a night hag and used as a currency on the lower planes.[56][26]: 69

Mortai	Planescape Monstrous Compendium Appendix II (1995)
Night Hag	Planescape Monstrous Compendium Appendix (1994) (as Nighthag)		Powerful hag from Hades, propagating evil by creating larvae.[56] Don Turnbull referred to the night hag as "splendid" and notes that the illustration of the night hag is the best drawing in the book.[81] It has been described as comparable to the Alp of folklore, although "considered a more Judeo-Christian demonic influence".[52]: 33

Phoenix	Monstrous Manual (1993)
Slaad	Monstrous Manual (1993) (Gray and Death by reference only), Planescape Monstrous Compendium Appendix (1994)	Red, Blue, Green, Gray and Death	Ed Greenwood considered the slaadi "worthy additions to any campaign".[147] GameSpy author Allan Rausch described the slaadi as "remorseless reptilian killing machines", but "For many years, slaad were a joke – because of their artwork", which showed them as "six-foot tall carnivorous frogs". With the Planescape setting they "were reinterpreted artistically to be less frog-like and much more fearsome".[17] Shannon Applecline considered the slaad one of the game's especially notable monsters.[14]: 38 
Tanar'ri	Monstrous Manual (1993), Planescape Monstrous Compendium Appendix (1994)		Renamed from demons in response to moral panic,[14]: 83–84 [21] many were based on figures from Christian demonology.[155] Considered among the "standard repertoire of "Monsters"" by Fabian Perlini-Pfister.[3] In a review of Planescape Monstrous Compendium Appendix II for Arcane magazine, the reviewer cites the culture of the tanar'ri as helping "give the Planes a solid base of peoples".[162]

Tanar'ri, Lesser – Cambion	Planescape Monstrous Compendium Appendix (1994)
Tanar'ri, Lesser – Succubus	Planescape Monstrous Compendium Appendix (1994)		Typical example of a demon, belonging to the "standard repertoire of "Monsters""[3] and one of those contributing to the moral panic;[23]: 106 [14]: 83–84  also an instance of the sexist tropes the game draws on which presented female sexuality as inherently dangerous.[26]: 17, 94  Rob Bricken of io9 identified the succubus as one of "The 12 Most Obnoxious Dungeons & Dragons Monsters".[90]
Tanar'ri, True – Balor	Monster Manual (1977),[5]: 223  Monstrous Manual (1993), Planescape Monstrous Compendium Appendix (1994)		Featuring a highly-muscled man-like body and bat wings, whip and jagged sword,[5]: 53  it is based on and renamed from the Balrog from J.R.R.

Umpleby	Monstrous Compendium Annual Volume Two (1995)		Trenton Webb, in his review of Monstrous Compendium Annual Two for British RPG magazine Arcane, called the shambling umpleby "without a shadow of a doubt" the star of the book: "Effectively a Bigfoot whose wooly hair generates shocking levels of static electricity, these hulking eccentric simpletons will test any parties patience and ability to save against cuteness." Webb also added that even without the umpleby the book "would be a necessary resource for all mainstream refs. With the shaggy-haired one, though, it rapidly approaches the essential."[168]

TSR 2139 – MC15 – Monstrous Compendium – Ravenloft Appendix II: Children of the Night (1993) – ISBN 1-56076-586-0
This appendix to the Monstrous Compendium series was designed for use with the Ravenloft campaign setting for the second edition of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game. The pack consisted of 32 5-hole punched loose-leaf pages, unnumbered, and included a 2-page "How To Use This Book" section, a 1-page description of the purpose of the "Children of the Night" supplement, a 1-page set of tables for Ravenloft random encounters, and a 1-page section updating the tables for calculation of experience points awarded for defeating any given creature. The remainder of the set consisted of the descriptions of specific fictional monsters and personalities in the Ravenloft campaign setting. Also included were 4 full-page illustrations on heavier card stock. The contents were republished in 1996 in paperback format within the Ravenloft Monstrous Compendium Appendices I & II.
Luis Javier Flores Arvizu named the continuous presence of supernatural beings as one of the factors that made Ravenloft a very well received role-playing game setting during the 33 years of its existence.[35]

TSR 2140 – Monstrous Manual (1993) – ISBN 1-56076-619-0
The Monstrous Manual was printed after the completion of the loose-leaf Monstrous Compendium series, in 1993. This book was "created in response to the many requests to gather monsters into a single, durable volume which would be convenient to carry." The Monstrous Manual compiled all of the monsters from Monstrous Compendium Volumes One and Two, as well as many creatures from subsequent volumes and other sources, and revised, updated, and in some cases condensed the entries; these are not duplicated here. The book is 384 pages.

Wilson called tieflings "the paranoid, loner obverse" of halflings, who "believe that life is out to get them". In the game they are "suited to be great thieves" and "point persons" due to favourable saving throw bonuses.[156]

TSR 2173 – Monstrous Compendium Annual Volume Four (1998) – ISBN 0-7869-1212-X
This 96-page soft-bound book contains creatures appearing in various TSR publications (magazines, game accessories, etc.). Unlike the previous annuals, the included monsters are not primarily drawn from the previous year's publications, but span a wide variety of years, possibly because TSR's financial woes resulted in very few products being produced in 1997. Also in a departure from the first three annuals, Volume Four includes a reference to the original appearance of the creature on each page. The Annual also contains a 3-page "How to Use This Book" section, which includes updated tables for the calculation of experience points awarded for defeating various creatures, and a 2-page index.
